= What This Plugin Does =

The core function of Portfolio Filter Gallery is to let you build galleries where users can click filter buttons to view specific categories of work. Instead of scrolling through an entire page of images, a visitor can select "Web Design" or "Photography" and see only those items.

The plugin includes a dedicated page for managing filter categories. You create your filters once, then assign them to individual images or videos as you build your gallery. This separation keeps your workflow clean and organized.

= Use Cases =

This plugin suits a range of users and projects:

* Photographers displaying work by genre (portraits, landscapes, events)
* Web designers showcasing projects by type (e-commerce, corporate, landing pages)
* Agencies presenting client work across different industries
* Architects organizing projects by category (residential, commercial, renovations)
* Artists grouping pieces by medium or theme
* Freelancers building a professional online presence

= Free Features =

**Gallery Filtering**

* Manage filters through a separate category interface
* Assign multiple filters to each gallery item
* CSS3 animations for smooth filter transitions

**Layout Options**

* Masonry layout that adapts to varying image dimensions
* Grid layout for uniform presentation
* Column options: 2, 3, or 4 columns
* Configurable spacing between items

**Lightbox**

* Bootstrap-based responsive lightbox
* Navigation arrows for browsing images
* Title display within the lightbox
* Touch support for mobile devices

**Video Support**

* Embed YouTube videos
* Embed Vimeo videos
* Videos play directly in the lightbox

**Customization**

* Show or hide image titles

= How to Use Portfolio Filter Gallery =

= Masonry Layout =

The masonry layout arranges images in a Pinterest-style grid. Images of different sizes fit together naturally without requiring uniform dimensions. This layout includes:

* Automatic adjustment to image proportions
* CSS3 animation effects
* Full compatibility with filtering and sorting

= Linking Portfolio Items =

You can attach custom URLs to individual gallery items. This allows you to:

* Link images to project detail pages
* Direct users to external client websites
* Open links in the same tab or a new tab

= Page Builder Compatibility =

Portfolio Filter Gallery works with standard WordPress editing tools and popular page builders:

* Gutenberg block editor
* Elementor
* WPBakery Page Builder
* Divi Builder
* Beaver Builder
